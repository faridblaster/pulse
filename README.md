Pulse can be use for monitoring heart rate by connecting compatible heart rate sensor to smartphone via bluetooth. Other person can monitor the heart rate using mobile application or browser.

This application was built within 24 hours and much effort used to figure out connecting Meteor application to the heart rate sensor. To make it usable, many other thing should be consider such as profile, security, notification (sms/email) and etc.


### Demo
The app must be run on mobile device to connect with the heart rate sensor via bluetooth. This app have been tested with iPhone 6 and Polar H7 heart rate sensor. Device listed [here](http://www.bluetooth.com/Pages/Bluetooth-Smart-Devices-List.aspx) should work.

On browser, it only show the current heart rate reading.
